# What Users Do 

<p>Good interface design doesn’t start with pictures. It starts with an understanding of people: what they’re like, why they use a given piece of software, and how they 
might interact with it. The more you know about them, and the more you empathize with 
them, the more effectively you can design for them. Software, after all, is merely a means 
to an end for the people who use it. The better you satisfy those ends, the happier those 
users will be.</p>

<br>

<p>There’s a maxim in the field of interface design: <b><i>“Know thy users, for they are not you!”</i></b></p>
<br>

## A Means to an End
Everyone who uses a tool—software or otherwise—has a reason for using it. For instance:

- Finding some fact or object
- Learning something
- Performing a transaction
- Controlling or monitoring something
- Creating something
- Conversing with other people
- Being entertained

<br>
<p>The first step in designing an interface is to figure out what its users are really trying to 
accomplish. Filling out a form, for example, is almost never a goal in and of itself—people 
only do it because they’re trying to buy something online, renew their driver’s license, or 
install software. They’re performing some kind of transaction.</p>

<p>The first step in designing an interface is to figure out what its users are really trying to 
accomplish. Filling out a form, for example, is almost never a goal in and of itself—people

install software. They’re performing some kind of transaction.</p>

<p>Why should you ask these questions if you have clear requirements? Because if you love 
designing things, it’s easy to get caught up in an interesting interface design problem. 
Maybe you’re good at building forms that ask for just the right information, with the 
right controls, all laid out nicely. But the real art of interface design lies in <i>solving the right 
  problem</i></p>
  
  <br>
  
Let’s use the “why” approach to dig a little deeper into some typical design scenarios.

- Why does a mid-level manager use an email client? Yes, of course—“to read email.” 
Why does she read and send email in the first place? To converse with other people. 
Of course, other means might achieve the same ends: the phone, a hallway conversation, a formal document. But apparently, email fills some needs that the other methods don’t. What are they, and why are they important to her? Privacy? The ability to 
archive a conversation? Social convention? What else?

- A father goes to an online travel agent, types in the city where his family will be taking 
a summer vacation, and tries to find plane ticket prices on various dates. He’s learning from what he finds, but his goal isn’t just to browse and explore different options. 
Ask why. His goal is actually a transaction: to buy plane tickets. Again, he could have 
done that at many different websites, or over the phone with a live travel agent. How 
is this site better than those other options? Is it faster? Friendlier? More likely to find 
a better deal?

- A mobile phone user wants a way to search through his contacts list more quickly. 
You, as the designer, can come up with some clever ideas to save keystrokes while 
searching. But why does he want it? It turns out that he makes a lot of calls while driving, and he doesn’t want to take his eyes off the road more than he has to—he wants to 
make calls while staying safe (to the extent that that’s possible). The ideal case is that 
he doesn’t have to look at the phone at all! A better solution is voice dialing: all he has 
to do is speak the name, and the phone makes the call for him.

- Sometimes goal analysis really isn’t straightforward at all. A snowboarding site might 
provide information (for learning), an online store (for transactions), and a set of 
Flash movies (for entertainment). Let’s say someone visits the site for a purchase, but 
she gets sidetracked into the information on snowboarding tricks—she has switched 
goals from accomplishing a transaction to browsing and learning. Maybe she’ll go 
back to purchasing something, maybe not. And does the entertainment part of the 
site successfully entertain both the 12-year-old and the 35-year-old? Will the 35-year old go elsewhere to buy his new board if he doesn’t feel at home there, or does he not 
care?


<p>It’s deceptively easy to model users as a single faceless entity—“The User”—walking 
through a set of simple use cases, with one task-oriented goal in mind. But that won’t 
necessarily reflect your users’ reality. </p>

<p>To do design well, you need to take many “softer” factors into account: gut reactions, 
preferences, social context, beliefs, and values. All of these factors could affect the design 
of an application or site. Among these softer factors, you may find the critical feature or 
design factor that makes your application more appealing and successful.</p>
<br>

## The Basics of User Research

<p>Empirical discovery is the only really good way to obtain this information. To get a design 
started, you’ll need to characterize the kinds of people who will be using your design 
(including the softer factors just mentioned), and the best way to do that is to go out and 
meet them.</p>

<p>Specifically, you’ll want to learn:</p>

- Their goals in using the software or site
- The specific tasks they undertake in pursuit of those goals
- The language and words they use to describe what they’re doing
- Their skill at using software similar to what you’re designing
- Their attitudes toward the kind of thing you’re designing, and how different designs 
might affect those attitudes

<br>

Although 
this book does not address user research, here are some methods and topics to consider:

<p><i>Direct observation</i><br>
Interviews and onsite user visits put you directly into the user’s world. You can ask 
users about what their goals are and what tasks they typically do. Usually done “on location,” where users would actually use the software (e.g., in a workplace or at home), 
interviews can be structured—with a predefined set of questions—or unstructured, 
where you probe whatever subject comes up. Interviews give you a lot of flexibility; 
you can do many or a few, long or short, formal or informal, on the phone or in person. 
These are great opportunities to learn what you don’t know. Ask why. Ask it again.</p>

<p><i>Case studies</i><br>
Case studies give you deep, detailed views into a few representative users or groups of 
users. You can sometimes use them to explore “extreme” users that push the boundaries of what the software can do, especially when the goal is a redesign of existing 
software. You can also use them as longitudinal studies—exploring the context of use 
over months or even years. Finally, if you’re designing custom software for a single 
user or site, you’ll want to learn as much as possible about the actual context of use.</p>

<p><i>Surveys</i><br>
Written surveys can collect information from many users. You can actually get statistically significant numbers of respondents with these. Since there’s no direct human contact, you will miss a lot of extra information—whatever you don’t ask about, you won’t 
learn about—but you can get a very clear picture of certain aspects of your target audience. Careful survey design is essential. If you want reliable numbers instead of a qualitative “feel” for the target audience, you absolutely must write the questions correctly, pick 
the survey recipients correctly, and analyze the answers correctly—and that’s a science.</p>

<p><i>Personas</i><br>
Personas aren’t a data-gathering method, but they do help you figure out what to do 
with your data once you’ve got it. This is a design technique that “models” the target 
audiences. For each major user group, you create a fictional person that captures the 
most important aspects of the users in that group: what tasks they’re trying to accomplish, their ultimate goals, and their experience levels in the subject domain and with 
computers in general. Personas can help you stay focused. As your design proceeds, 
you can ask yourself questions such as “Would this fictional person really do X? What 
would she do instead?”</p>

<br>
<p>You might notice that some of these methods and topics, such as interviews and surveys, 
sound suspiciously like marketing activities. That’s exactly what they are.The difference is that as a designer, you’re trying to understand the people who use the 
software. A marketing professional tries to understand those who buy it. </p>

<br>

## Users’ Motivation to Learn

Before you start the design process, consider your overall approach. Think about how you 
might design the interface’s overall interaction style—its personality, if you will.

<p>When you carry on a conversation with someone about a given subject, you adjust what 
you say according to your understanding of the other person. You might consider how 
much he cares about the subject, how much he already knows about it, how receptive he is 
to learning from you, and whether he’s even interested in the conversation in the first place. 
If you get any of that wrong, bad things happen—he might feel patronized, uninterested, 
impatient, or utterly baffled.</p>

<p>Some of these concerns permeate the whole interface design in subtle ways. For example, 
do your users expect a short, tightly focused exchange about something very specific, or 
do they prefer a conversation that’s more of a free-ranging exploration? In other words, 
how much openness is there in the interface? Too little, and your users feel trapped and 
unsatisfied; too much, and they stand there paralyzed, not knowing what to do next, unprepared for that level of interaction</p>

Software designed for intermediate-to-expert users includes:
- Photoshop
- Dreamweaver
- Excel
- Code development environments
- System-administration tools for web servers


In contrast, here are some things designed for occasional users:
- Kiosks in tourist centers or museums
- Windows or Mac OS controls for setting desktop backgrounds
- Purchase pages for online stores
- Installation wizards
- Automated teller machines

<p>Now that you’ve seen the extremes, look at the applications in the middle of the continuum:</p>

- Microsoft PowerPoint
- Email clients
- Facebook
- Blog-writing tools

<p>The truth is that most applications fall into this middle ground. They need to serve people on both ends adequately—to help new users learn the tool (and satisfy their need 
for instant gratification), while enabling frequent-user intermediates to get things done 
smoothly. Their designers probably knew that people wouldn’t take a three-day course to 
learn an email client. Yet the interfaces hold up under repeated usage. People quickly learn 
the basics, reach a proficiency level that satisfies them, and don’t bother learning more 
until they are motivated to do so for specific purposes.</p>

<p>You may someday find yourself in tension between the two ends of this spectrum. 
Naturally you want people to be able to use your design “out of the box,” but you might 
also want to support frequent or expert users as much as possible. Find a balance that 
works for your situation. Organizational patterns in Chapter 2, such as Multi-Level Help, 
can help you serve both constituencies.</p>

<br>

## Patterns

When you observe people using your software, or doing whatever activity you want to 
support with new software, you can expect them to do certain things. The behavioral patterns that follow are often seen in user observations. Odds are good that you’ll see them 
too, especially if you look for them.

<p><i>(A note for pattern enthusiasts: these patterns aren’t like the others in this book. They 
describe human behaviors—not interface design elements—and they’re not prescriptive, 
like the patterns in other chapters. Instead of being structured like the other patterns, 
  these are presented as small essays.)</i></p>

<p>Again, an interface that supports these patterns well will help users achieve their goals 
far more effectively than interfaces that don’t support them. And the patterns are not just 
about the interface, either. Sometimes the entire package—interface, underlying architecture, feature choice, documentation, everything—needs to be considered in light of these 
behaviors. But as the interface designer or interaction designer, you should think about 
these as much as anyone on your team. You might be in a better place than anyone to 
advocate for the users.</p>

<br>

- Safe Exploration


<i>“Let me explore without getting lost or getting into trouble.”</i>
<br>
When someone feels like she can explore an interface and not suffer dire consequences, 
she’s likely to learn more—and feel more positive about it—than someone who doesn’t explore. Good software allows people to try something unfamiliar, back out, and try something else, all without stress.

<br>

- Instant Gratification

People like to see immediate results from the actions they take—it’s human nature. If 
someone starts using an application and gets a “success experience” within the first few 
seconds, that’s gratifying! He’ll be more likely to keep using it, even if it gets harder later. 
He will feel more confident in the application, and more confident in himself, than if it 
had taken a while to figure things out.

<br>


- Satisficing

When people look at a new interface, they don’t read every piece of it methodically and 
then decide, “Hmmm, I think this button has the best chance of getting me what I want.” 
Instead, a user will rapidly scan the interface, pick whatever he sees first that might get 
him what he wants, and try it—even if it might be wrong.
<br><br>
The term satisficing is a combination of satisfying and sufficing. It was coined in 1957 by 
the social scientist Herbert Simon, who used it to describe the behavior of people in all 
kinds of economic and social situations. People are willing to accept “good enough” instead of “best” if learning all the alternatives might cost time or effort.

<br>

- Changes in Midstream

Occasionally, people change what they’re doing while in the middle of doing it. Someone 
may walk into a room with the intent of finding a key she had left there, but while she’s there, 
she finds a newspaper and starts reading it. Or she may visit Amazon.com to read product 
reviews, but ends up buying a book instead. Maybe she’s just sidetracked; maybe the change 
is deliberate. Either way, the user’s goal changes while she’s using the interface you designed.
<br><br>
This means designers should provide opportunities for people to do that. Make choices 
available. Don’t lock users into a choice-poor environment with no connections to other 
pages or functionality unless there’s a good reason to do so. Those reasons do exist. See 
the patterns called Wizard (Chapter 2) and Modal Panel (Chapter 3) for examples.

<br>
  
- Deferred Choices

This follows from people’s desire for instant gratification. If you ask a task-focused user 
unnecessary questions in the process, he may prefer to skip the questions and come back 
to them later.
<br><br>
For example, some web-based bulletin boards have long and complicated procedures 
for registering users. Screen names, email addresses, privacy preferences, avatars, selfdescriptions…the list goes on and on. “But I just wanted to post one little thing,” says the 
user plaintively. Why not allow him to skip most of the questions, answer the bare minimum, and come back later (if ever) to fill in the rest? Otherwise, he might be there for half 
an hour answering essay questions and finding the perfect avatar image.

<br>


- Incremental Construction

When people create things, they don’t usually do it all in a precise order. Even an expert 
doesn’t start at the beginning, work through the creation process methodically, and come 
out with something perfect and finished at the end.
<br><br>
Quite the opposite. Instead, she starts with some small piece of it, works on it, steps back 
and looks at it, tests it (if it’s code or some other “runnable” thing), fixes what’s wrong, and 
starts to build other parts of it. Or maybe she starts over, if she really doesn’t like it. The 
creative process goes in fits and starts. It moves backward as much as forward sometimes, 
and it’s often incremental, done in a series of small changes instead of a few big ones. 
Sometimes it’s top-down; sometimes it’s bottom-up.
<br><br>
Builder-style interfaces need to support that style of work. Make it easy for users to build 
small pieces. Keep the interface responsive to quick changes and saves. Feedback is critical: constantly show the user what the whole thing looks and behaves like, while the user 
works. If the user builds code, simulations, or other executable things, make the “compile” 
part of the cycle as short as possible, so the operational feedback feels immediate—leave 
little or no delay between the user making changes and seeing the results.
