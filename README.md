# Designing Interfaces Notes

### Preface:-
<p>One could say,<code>“The applications that are easy to use are designed to be intuitive.”</code><br> <br>Well, 
yes. That’s almost a tautology.</p>

<p>Except that the word “intuitive” is a little bit deceptive. Jef Raskin once pointed out that 
when we say “intuitive” in the context of software, we really mean “familiar.” Computer 
mice aren’t intuitive to someone who’s never seen one (though a growling grizzly bear 
would be). There’s nothing innate or instinctive in the human brain to account for it. But 
once you’ve taken ten seconds to learn to use a mouse, it’s familiar, and you’ll never forget 
it. Same for blue underlined text, play/pause buttons, and so on.</p>

<br>
<p>Rephrased: <code>“The applications that are easy to use are designed to be familiar.”</code></p>

<p>Now we’re getting somewhere. “Familiar” doesn’t necessarily mean that everything about 
a given application is identical to some genre-defining product (e.g., Word, Photoshop, 
Mac OS, or a Walkman). People are smarter than that. As long as the parts are recognizable enough and the relationships among the parts are clear, then people can apply their 
previous knowledge to a novel interface and figure it out</p>
